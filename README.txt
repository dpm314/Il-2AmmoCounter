Launch from CMD window with
>python ammoCounter.py
Dependencies: Python 2.7 with pygame installed

Select Plane with Il-2 minimized by pressing: 
"7" for Yak7
"B" for Yak-1b
"Y" for Yak69
"M" for Mig
"L" for Lagg-3 with 23mm Cannon option

Default MG is Joystick 0, Button 0
Default Cannon Joystick 0, Button 2
Default Reset is Joystick 0, Button 15

These can be edited in ammoCounter_config.py with any text editor.
Currently, you must determine the joystic and button's manually (check ingame or use device manager etc.), and edit ammoCounter_config.py accordingly

Note: You cannot switch plane unless you minimize Il-2 to not be in fullscreen mode. You can reset the ammo counter anytime when playing by hitting the reset button (default above). 

This software has only been tested on Windows 7 with a Thrustmaster T16000 Stick. 
Known Bug: Python Kernel restart may be required if window not closed properly ...
